								<h3>Fimbel Maker and Innovation Lab</h3>
								<p><a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/fimbellab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Fimbel Maker and Innovation Lab</a> at Mount Holyoke College is an 8,000-square-foot Makerspace. It is completely student-run every evening, and I have been working there since 2019.</p>
								<p>In Fimbel, we are required to have a baseline of technical knowledge deeper than what is necessary in any other space on campus. It is impossible to be intimidated by new equipment when you have to teach it to someone almost immediately after learning it. Every day, someone walks in with an idea that would have never occurred to me, and I must be resiliently creative enough to arm them with the skills to figure it out. In my first semester, I helped a student design and build a full Settlers of Catan game board. That spring, I assisted my first workshop (about 3D modeling a chocolate bar), and I cut a fleet of planks with a student who had designed a composter for her research. Within the year, I was preparing to lead a laser cutting workshop for a group of 15 people, none of whom had any experience. All of the people who I have worked with have slowly become more confident in their abilities, and it is gratifying to see that my efforts to make the space less intimidating for newcomers have been successful. In concert with my other mentorship positions, the Fimbel Lab has allowed me to teach people new skills and improve my capacity for growth and creative learning, which has been incredibly fun.</p>
